title: "The Myth of the 'Born Programmer'"
---

Not long ago, I was on a panel of some incredible people who joined the
software development field via "non-traditional" paths. We had business
people, and mathematicians, and a civil engineer, but we all agreed on one 
idea:

## The born programmer doesn't exist.

It's an idea you encounter often on the web: don't learn a language, learn to
program. Read [Introduction to Algorithms](http://amzn.to/2gVPRWa) and if you
can't figure it out, then you're just _not_ a programmer.

I hate this idea with every fiber of my being despite often being an example
of the stereotype.

I've taught people how to program who believed they just didn't have it in
them.
