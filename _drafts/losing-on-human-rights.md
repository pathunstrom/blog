title: "We don't lose on human rights."

[Inspiration](https://twitter.com/GarthFT/status/809526663067340802)

Decentralized governments make the fight for minority rights tens of thousands
of little wars instead of a single war.

"Losing" is different in rights battles. The fight is incremental and does not
backslide easily.

Our opponents aren't actually harmed by us winning, and we are actually harmed
by losing, simplified: We have skin in the game, our opponents don't.
