title: "Requisite Terrible First Blog"
---

This is hardly my first blog, and knowing myself it will hardly be my
last. Every blog I've ever run starts of slow while I discover the
niche inside the niche. In this case, I'm going to start putting my
thoughts together regarding technical topics, mostly Python and hobby
games development.

While I work on that, I guess I'll ramble a bit about blogging in
general.

It's interesting, honestly, that I've been a subject matter expert in
so many communities. Among the writers who were once my peers, I was
the technologist who could teach them a thing or two about automating
things. In school I was the business major among programmers teaching
people how to calculate costs as we designed systems. Now, I'm the
pythonista that _really_ loves games.

So that familiar feeling of taking charge of what I know and being
willing to be called on it by the public.
